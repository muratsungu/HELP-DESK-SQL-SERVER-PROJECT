# HELP-DESK-SQL-SERVER-PROJECT
Help desk is a process that aims to provide information and support to users who need technical support for a company's products or services. Help desk systems are needed to manage the process effectively and efficiently. 
By using help desk systems which have a very important place in IT business process management, all employees and end users of the enterprise are gathered on the same platform and fast and practical solutions are offered for the demands and problems of the customers. The performance for customer support can be monitored through these systems. The data obtained are guiding in determining strategies in the long or short term. 
In this project, a help desk system was designed for a company operating in the software industry. The queries and reporting required for database design and operations are included.
